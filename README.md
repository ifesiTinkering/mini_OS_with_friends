This is the source code of a mini operating system I made, alongside two friends for a class project in undergrad.

To run this OS, you need to run the boot.S in the student-distrib folder.

You should be able to use basic terminal commands like ls, cat, mkdir, tc. and open the pre-loaded files.

With the scheduler, youcan also have two or three files open at a time. I'll include a demo video to show this running is you cannot set it up on your system.

Currently, I add more features to the OS (like a the distubuted file system I am currently working on) in my spare time. 

It is also a fun way to practice new topics I lean in my computer architecture class this semester.

Feel free to poke around!
